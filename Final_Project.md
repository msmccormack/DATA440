# Project 2

For Project 2, I began by requesting data for Senegal from DHS; the most recent year I could find was 2016. My proposal for this data can be found on my index ![here](ProjectProposal2.md). 
After the proposal was successful and I had access to the Senegal data, I imported the household survey dataset and looked at that data.

As you can see, there are a staggering amount of entries and columns in this dataset. To be more specific, there are 4,437 households accounted for in this dataset and 7,415 possible variables. To calculate the total number of persons, I took the sum of the size column; which gave me a total of 41,632 individuals. I identified the following variables as such:

Household ID : hhid

Unit : hv004
