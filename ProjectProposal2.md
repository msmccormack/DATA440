# Generating Synthetic Population Data for Project 2: Proposal

The purpose of this research is to improve upon the use of multinomial logistic regression models to generate a closer-to-reality synthetic population by specifying, estimating 
and validating a continuous spatial model. Central to achieving this research goal of continuous spatial multinomial logistic regression model 
(for inferring conditional probabilities) will be increasing the resolution of the sampling unit from political subdivisions to individual households. 
I will achieve this goal through meeting the following objectives.

1. Use remotely sensed data to estimate all dwelling unit locations
in Senegal, particularly in the subdivision of Diourbel.

2. Use survey data to estimate a spatially continuous multinomial
logistic regression model for predicting household size, gender and
age of all dwelling units in Diourbel.

3. Use survey data to estimate a spatially continuous multinomial
logistic regression model for predicting the remaining demographic
characteristics of all household members.

These data will also help me investigate how roads, health care facilities,
settlements, and households all interact in a greater setting of a network.
Overall, this DHS data will be instrumental in furthering my research.
