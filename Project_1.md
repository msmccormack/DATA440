# Project 1

The lower-middle income country I chose for project 1 is Senegal. The geospatial representation of Senegal and the barplot for the population distribution of Senegal is shown side by side, below.

From both plots, it is apparent that Dakar is a very highly/densely populated area. This makes sense, because Dakar is the country's capital - usually, the capital of a country is highly populated. Additionally, it is the most western point of the African mainland, and it "has historically served as the gateway to West Africa", which makes it a vital location.[^fn] Areas close to Dakar also have a relatively higher population than some of the other administrative areas, which is also logical because it is more desireable to be close to the capital. The least populous/dense area of Senegal is the adminstrative area of Kedougou, which is the furthest area away from Dakar. Its population is a mere 178,464 people. The population density of Dakar and areas close to it, particularly Thies and Diourbel, are substantially highere than most of the other areas. Dakar in particular has a very high density of about 6479 people per kilometer squared. Meanwhile, Kedougou has a population density of about only 10 people per kilometer squared (despite its area being over sixteen thousand square kilometers larger than Dakar's area).
