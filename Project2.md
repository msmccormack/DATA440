# Project 2

For project 2, I began by requesting data for Senegal from DHS. My proposal for this data can be found on my index. 
After the proposal was successful and I had access to Senegal's data, I imported the household survey dataset and looked at that data.

As you can see, there are many entries and columns in this dataset. More specifically, there are 4,437 households accounted for in this dataset. To calculate the total number of persons, I took the sum of the size column; which gave me a total of 41,632 individuals. I identified the following variables as such:

Unit : hv004

Survey weights : hv005

Number of household members : hv009/1000000

Location (this variable had both urban and rural, I combined these for each ADM1): hv022

Gender of household members : columns 468-533

Age of household members : columns 534-599

Education : columns 600-665

Wealth : hv270
