# Project 2

For project 2, I began by requesting data for Senegal from DHS. My proposal for this data can be found on my index. 
After the proposal was successful and I had access to Senegal's data, I imported the household survey dataset and looked at that data.

As you can see, there are many entries and columns in this dataset. More specifically, there are 4,437 households accounted for in this dataset. To calculate the total number of persons, I took the sum of the size column; which gave me a total of 41,632 individuals. I identified the following variables as such:

Unit : hv004

Survey weights : hv005

Number of household members : hv009/1000000

Location (this variable had both urban and rural, I combined these for each ADM1): hv022

Gender of household members : columns 468-533

Age of household members : columns 534-599

Education : columns 600-665

Wealth : hv270

## Provide a written description of your spatially located households at the adm0 level of your selected location, including how you located each household, generated the household structure including demographic attributes of persons, and the percent error calculated. If you faced computational issues at the adm0 level when attempting to pivot from households to persons, describe those limitations.

## Provide a written description of your spatially located households at the adm1 or adm2 level of your selected location, again including how you located each household, generated the household structure including demographic attributes of persons, and the percent error calculated. Further analyze your synthetically generated households and persons with regard to percent error. Do you think this population is more or less accurate than the one generated at the adm0 level? What could you have done to improve your measures of accuracy?

## When compared to a randomly generated synthetic population that describes the demographic attributes of households and persons, does yours more closely approximate reality? How is yours an improvement over a synthetic population that was generated in accordance with complete spatial randomness? Generate plots and incorporate results from your work as evidence in support of an argument that the synthetic population you generated is a good approximation of the reality that existed in your selected location at that given time.
