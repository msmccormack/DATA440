# Project 2

For project 2, I began by requesting data for Senegal from DHS. My proposal for this data can be found on my index. 
After the proposal was successful and I had access to Senegal's data, I imported the household survey dataset and looked at that data.

As you can see, there are many entries and columns in this dataset. I then identified the following variables as such:


Survey weights : hv005

Number of household members : hv009

Location of your selected research area (country code and phase): hv000

Gender of household members : columns 468-533

Age of household members : columns 534-599
